<h2>ingredient</h2>
<h3>Â½ tbsp olive oil
    1 onion, peeled and finely chopped
    1 x 500g pack British Beef Steak Mince 15% fat
    1 tsp mixed dried herbs
    1 egg, beaten
    4 slices mature Cheddar (optional)
    4 white rolls
    few round lettuce leaves, torn
    1 beef tomato, sliced
    ketchup, to serve (optional)</h3>
 
<h2>method</h2>
 <h3>Heat the olive oil in a frying pan, add the onion and cook for 5 minutes until softened and starting to turn golden. Set aside.
    In a bowl, combine the beef mince with the herbs and the egg. Season, add the onions and mix well. Using your hands, shape into 4 patties.
    Cook the burgers on a preheated barbecue or griddle for 5-6 minutes on each side. While the second side is cooking, lay a slice of cheese on top to melt slightly (if using).
    Meanwhile, lightly toast the cut-sides of the buns on the barbecue. Fill with the lettuce, burgers and tomato slices. Serve with ketchup, if you like.</h3>
